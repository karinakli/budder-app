# Budder High-Fidelity Prototype

### TOOLS USED 
We built our high-fidelity prototype with React Native and Expo. We used Apple’s Xcode Simulator and our mobile devices downloaded with the Expo Go app to run and test our app in development. Lastly, we used Google Firebase to store data and do user authentication. 

### OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 
Using Expo Go You can access our prototype on an iOS device, Android device, or online. We recommend viewing it on iOS device. (Note: the app has been optimized for the iPhone 12) 
1. Download “Expo Go” from the App Store 
2. Login to Expo with username: appbudder@gmail.com / password: cs147budder 
3. Open your phone browser and visit https://expo.dev/@budder/budder?serviceType=classic&distribution=expogo 
4. Click on the black button labeled “Open in Expo Go” 
5. Wait for the app to finish loading. This may take a while depending on the wifi connection. 
6. Enjoy budder! 

### LIMITATIONS 
1. Users cannot change or update their memory reels from either their camera roll or from the active camera feature. Although they can take a picture, the information is not saved onto the current friendship profile. 
2. Not all app elements are fully responsive to different phone and device sizes. We tried to make the font and image sizes scalable to different devices, but due to time constraints in the app’s development, we were unable to make all features fully responsive. 
3. When users first create their account, they are suggested to add friends from the entire budder database network. Instead of being recommended to add friends that you already know or importing friends from your contacts, users can only select which friends they want to add from everyone already on the app. 

### WIZARD OF OZ 
We employed the Wizard of Oz technique in a few key areas in our app to implement the key aspects of the user experience. Generating custom itineraries based on user preferences is implemented through Wizard of Oz and does not actually depend on a working algorithm. 

### HARD-CODED ITEMS 
To create the experience of a fully functioning app, we hard-coded various information into our prototype. 
1. All friends in the database have been manually added to simulate an active social network. 
2. The memories reel is hard coded in for each user. Every user will view the same memories reel whether or not they upload their own. 
3. Suggested itineraries have all been entered in as the default option for brunch in San Francisco. 
4. The number of memories that each person has with their friends and the date when they last met-up are both hard-coded.
